                <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                <p>When forced indoor, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows. I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front end web development world.</p>
